Java For Loop
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:
Syntax
for ( statement 1 ; statement 2 ; statement 3 ) {
  // code block to be executed 
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:
Example
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
Example explained
Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (int i = 0).
Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5). If the condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, the loop will end.
Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.
Another Example
This example will only print even values between 0 and 10:
Example
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {
  System.out.println(i);
}

Java for loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition. The for loop in Java provides an efficient way to iterate over a range of values, execute code multiple times, or traverse arrays and collections.
Example:
Java
class Geeks {
public static void main ( String args [] ) {
// for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5
for ( int i = 1 ; i <= 5 ; i ++ ) {
System . out . println ( "" + i );
}
System . out . println ( "Loop has ended." );
}
}
Output 1
2
3
4
5
Loop has ended.
 Dry-Running Above Example
The program starts. The for loop initializes i to 1. Condition i <= 5 is checked. If true: Statement inside the loop executes, printing the current value of i. Increment i by 1. If false: Loop terminates, and the program continues. Steps repeat until i becomes 6, at which point the condition fails, and “Loop has ended.” is printed. Syntax for (initialization expr; test expr; update exp) { // body of the loop // statements we want to execute }
Working Control enters the for loop . Initialization is executed once at the beginning of the loop. The Condition is evaluated: If true, the control moves to Step 4. If false, the control jumps to Step 7. The body of the loop is executed. Control moves to the Updation step. After Updation , the flow returns to the Condition (Step 3) and repeats the process. Once the condition becomes false, the control exits the for loop, and statements outside the loop are executed.
Example 1: Printing Numbers from 1 to 10
Java
// Java program to print numbers from 1 to 10
class GFG {
public static void main ( String [] args ) {
for ( int i = 1 ; i <= 10 ; i ++ ) {
System . out . println ( i );
}
}
}
Output 1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Example 2: Printing “Hello World” 5 Times
Java
// Java program to illustrate for loop
class GFG {
public static void main ( String args [] ) {
// Writing a for loop
// to print Hello World 5 times
for ( int i = 1 ; i <= 5 ; i ++ )
System . out . println ( "Hello World" );
}
}
Output Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Example 3: Calculating Sum from 1 to 20
Java
// Java program to calculate the
// sum of numbers from 1 to 20
class GFG {
public static void main ( String args [] ) {
int s = 0 ;
// for loop begins
// and runs till x <= 20
for ( int x = 1 ; x <= 20 ; x ++ ) {
s = s + x ;
}
System . out . println ( "Sum: " + s );
}
}
Output Sum: 210

Java for Loop (With Examples)
In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. For example, if you want to show a message 100 times, then rather than typing the same code 100 times, you can use a loop.
In Java, there are three types of loops.
for loop
while loop
do...while loop
This tutorial focuses on the for loop. You will learn about the other types of loops in the upcoming tutorials.
Java for Loop
Java for loop is used to run a block of code for a certain number of times. The syntax of for loop is:
for (initialExpression; testExpression; updateExpression) {
 // body of the loop
}
Here,
The initialExpression initializes and/or declares variables and executes only once.
The condition is evaluated. If the condition is true , the body of the for loop is executed.
The updateExpression updates the value of initialExpression .
The condition is evaluated again. The process continues until the condition is false .
Example 1: Display a Text Five Times
// Program to print a text 5 times

class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
int n = 5;
 // for loop
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
 System.out.println("Java is fun");
 }
 }
}
Output
Java is fun
Java is fun
Java is fun
Java is fun
Java is fun
Example 2: Display numbers from 1 to 5
// Program to print numbers from 1 to 5

class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
int n = 5;
 // for loop
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
 System.out.println(i);
 }
 }
}
Output
1
2
3
4
5
Example 3: Display Sum of n Natural Numbers
// Program to find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 1000.

class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
int sum = 0;
 int n = 1000;
// for loop
 for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
 // body inside for loop
 sum += i; // sum = sum + i
 }
System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
 }
}
Output :
Sum = 500500
